# roboflow-stationary-object-detection-project
Object detection model trained with Roboflow to identify stationary objects in real-time using YOLO and computer vision.

This project is an AI-powered object detection system designed to identify stationary objects (e.g. bags, boxes) in a monitored environment. It was developed using Roboflow for dataset management and model training, and integrates with YOLOv8 and OpenCV for real-time detection and visualization.

The goal is to create a lightweight detection system useful in areas like surveillance, security, or crowd monitoring where unattended objects may pose safety risks.
